Workshop-1 part-2

During work on workshop 1 I learned how to receive program arguments from the command line. I did it by changing properties 
of my project to be more specific “Debugging -> Command line”. I added there needed names of text files and project recognized 
this files inside the directory with help of a main attributes number and array of char. After that project opened the and 
recorded them into class. 
Also during work on workshop 1 I stumbled upon a problem with externals I didn’t know that to use them 
I need to declare them globally even inside its own cpp file when they were declared in header file before that. Because of 
that I received unresolved externals. If I understand correctly external linkage can be used by anyone who call in globally 
first”foodorder.cpp-18 double g_taxrate; double g_dailydiscount;”, when internal can be used only inside 
a class”foodorder.cpp-56 static int COUNTER = 0;”.
I have created static int for COUNTER in display, so it will only be in a stack as instruction required.
In part 2 I added destructor and read description as string until coma and then send it to set function as .c_str(), 
so it can read string as char.

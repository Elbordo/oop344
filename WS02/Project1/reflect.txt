Workshop-2 part-2

This big of a difference in time between copy and move operations is because move() provides more efficient and sufficient 
way for resource transfer between objects. Move() changes an expression from an lvalue to xvalue and this xvalue can be moved 
without saving its buffer memory, so its going faster.
In this workshop I learned how to use library chrono for counting time in c++ with help of class template duration that reads 
interval of time, time_point that stores a value of type duration, nanoseconds that converts duration into nanoseconds.
I learned how to use unsigned int with size_t I was quite frustrated because I didnâ€™t know that size_t is unsigned int but 
matrix compiler helped me here.
I learned how to implement move() function when using copy assignment and copy operator and moving data instead of assigning 
and then clearing it like m_arr = p.m_arr; p.m_arr = nullptr;
m_stored = p.m_stored; p.m_stored = 0;

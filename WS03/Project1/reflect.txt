Workshop-3 part-2

It is needed to specify add member function to check absolute flat value and check if I still can 
add items if (std::fabs(item - this->array[i]) <= 0.01).
The reason for defining the class variable outside the class definition is that each static object 
can be defined only once.
In this workshop I learned how to design and code a class template and template a class variable template<class T, 
size_t CAPACITY> where T is a type of all elements in collection and capacity is a maximum number of elements that 
can be added to capacity.
In this workshop I learned how to specialize a member function of a templated class to process a particular type like in 
set for double type to convert from unsigned int.
In this workshop I learned how to derive a templated class from another templated class  template<class T>
    class Set : public Collection<T, 100
